- ‚úÖ Minimal static landing page (`public/index.html`) confirming the endpoint is online.
- ‚úÖ `netlify.toml` with:
  - `functions = "netlify/functions"`
  - `publish = "public"`
  - `NODE_VERSION = "22"` in `build.environment`
- ‚úÖ ESLint and Prettier configuration with ESM support, but with JSON linting removed due to compatibility friction.
