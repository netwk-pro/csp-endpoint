---

## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-11

### Added

- Initial Netlify Function `csp-report.js` to receive CSP violation reports via `POST`.
- Report filtering to ignore low-value sources (e.g. `img-src`, `chrome-extension://`, etc.).
- High-risk directive detection (`script-src`, `form-action`, etc.).
- Deduplication logic to prevent spam from duplicate CSP reports.
- Alert delivery to `https://ntfy.neteng.pro/csp-alerts` for high-risk CSP events.
- Minimal static landing page (`public/index.html`) confirming the endpoint is online.
- `netlify.toml` with:
  - `functions = "netlify/functions"`
  - `publish = "public"`
- ESLint and Prettier configuration with ESM support, but with JSON linting removed due to compatibility friction.
- `.node-version` and `.nvmrc` for proper Node.js resolution.
  - Ensures compatibility with Netlify‚Äôs dynamic Node version installation.
  - Uses explicit version `24.4.0` to avoid ambiguous builds and failures.

### Changed

- üîÅ CSP header in main SvelteKit project updated to point to new report URI:

```bash
https://csp.netwk.pro/.netlify/functions/csp-report
```

### Removed

- üóëÔ∏è Deprecated inline CSP reporting route (`/api/csp-report`) from original SvelteKit project.
